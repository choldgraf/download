⚠️⚠️This package is not actively maintained⚠️⚠️

**Instead, I recommend that you use `pooch <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch>`_ which has more features, better implementation, and active maintenance.**

A no-frills tool to download files from the web. It will
attempt to be smart about not downloading data that's
already there, checking to make sure that
there were no errors in fetching data, automatically unzipping the contents
of downloaded zipfiles (if desired), and displaying a progress bar with
statistics.

.. note::

    This draws heavily from the
    `MNE-python <https://martinos.org/mne>`_ ``_fetch_file`` function.

_This package doesn't get a ton of developer attention, but is hopefully well-scoped
enough that it should still be useful! If you'd like to help improve it, fix bugs, etc,
please reach out in the issues!_

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

.. _faq/file-size:

Why do I occasionally get a "Error file size is..." error?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, when you try to download a file, the server from
which you are downloading will return that the download is finished,
when it is not. ``download`` will check whether the final downloaded
file is the correct size. If not, it will throw this error. In this case,
you should try re-downloading the file.
